# Just Dance Now Chart API
This repository is the back-end part of the Just Dance Now chart project.
The following technologies are used:
* ASP.NET as main API building framework
* Entity Framework for communication with an SQL database
* Hangfire for scheduling database seeding jobs

This is still WIP, so hang in there!
